										Giant metal and rock structures carrying inexplicable symbols and drawings. The structures emit signals and receive others 
										from unknown sources. Scientists have been unable to determine the age of the structures, who made them, or for what purpose.
										The most common hypothesis is that the structures are the remains of an ancient civilization from another planet, perhaps from 
										the neighboring galaxy Andromeda. Some scientists believe the structures are part of a secret project to contact alien life,
										 perhaps by a government or secret organization. There are those who believe that the structures are the result of a failed
										  experiment to create a portal to another world, perhaps by mad scientists or cult groups.
										No one knows the truth behind this mysterious phenomenon, and research is still ongoing to decipher
										 the structures and signals. But what is worrying is that some structures have begun to change shape
										  and color randomly, and that some signs have begun to contain threatening and warning messages. Is 
										  this just a coincidence, or is there an invisible force trying to communicate with us? If so, what do they want from us?
