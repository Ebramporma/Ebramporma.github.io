									<h2>Architecture form,space and order (Francis D.K Ching)</h2>
									<p> We know that the concept of language is those letters that have sounds in our human perception.
										 They begin to form a meaning when they converge and unite together. They appear to us in their
										  linear form across the lines of parallel books, but the meaning transcends the form and takes 
										  us far into the seas of thought and reasoning. The meaning is preserved in the laws of the 
										  language, that is, in the grammatical rules of the language, then we begin to express,
										   describe, interpret, request, etc. The meaning goes beyond the form of words and sentences
										    and takes us towards the message and content, to make one plus one equal more than two. 
											Then we begin measuring and analyzing</p>
									<p> This is how it is when we measure an architectural work, we measure it by the elements that we read in it. Every architectural work with its geometric elements is considered a form language that goes beyond the form and takes us towards message and content 
										(expressively and symbolically) with the formal elements molded by the rules of engineering.</p>
									<p> In the book (Architecture: form, Space, and order), Francis Cheng tells us, as he lays the foundation for our understanding of form languages, how the mind comprehends the world of architecture, which is formed from the basic and elementary elements, starting with the point, line,
										 and plane, and how the human eyes read them, and how the human mind begins to perceive them.</p>
										 <li>He tells us about the elements of the primary form that constitutes the space and which can be received and tested. Some of them we can easily detect their meaning and message while others are more mysterious to our minds and feelings. Some sentences play a dominant role and others have secondary roles in organizing volumes and spaces.
										 Some of them convey images and meanings while others act as connectives and prepositions. Indispensable.</li>
										 <li>And about the interconnection of elements and systems to form an integrated whole with a unified and cohesive structure. Architectural order exists when there are visible relationships between the individual parts and then the building as a whole. These relationships, which vary in their order and irregularity, in turn control our response to the meanings that the image calls for.
										.</li>
										<li> The nature of emptiness and that just as we realize the nature of what is (mass), we must also realize the nature of what is not (emptiness). Through emptiness we move, see masses, hear sounds, and smell. It is a material entity like wood and stone, but nevertheless, by its nature it is a formless vapor. Its visible formation, its dimensions and scale, the properties of its light - all of these properties depend on our awareness of the spatial boundaries defined by the elements of mass. When the space begins to be restricted and organized by the elements of mass, architecture comes into being
										.</li>
										<li> How do we translate the visual interaction between positive elements (mass) and negative elements (empty), because our visual field consists of disparate elements that differ in nature, shape, dimensions, color, texture, and orientation. Our human mind tends to divide visual elements into two opposing groups, elements that are received as an image and others that are the background of this image.
										.</li>
										<li> The book tends towards application, as it presents the basic methods through which the 
											foundations of architectural connection can be organized into harmonious patterns of mass and space,
											 which in turn form the identity of buildings from their formal language.</li>

									<h2>Unified architectural theory (Nikos Salingaros - Christopher Alexander)</h2>
									<li>It is called unified because it helps in describing and interpreting all architectural theories and trends under one framework, which is that architecture is a human act that changes the ecosystem, and humans are part of the ecosystem. Away from intellectual, philosophical or political biases, away from abstract societal standards. Architecture is not mechanical but living, and its judgment is not based on the ideas of modernity or attached to the ideas of originality. It allows comparison between different theories of how a building appears and how it interacts and communicates with its surroundings. Its main topic is natural and man-made systems.
									.</li>
									<li>Respecting the human scale instead of strange, disintegrating shapes
									.</li>
									<li>Not neglecting our experimental human history of architecture, which is the legacy of traditional solutions for architecture that loves nature and people
									.</li>
									<li>Built on smart foundations. Contact with different fields of knowledge – sociology, psychiatry, human sciences, etc
									.</li>
									<li>Design within a specific formal language adapted to the building’s self-system and adapted to nature
									.</li>
									<li>The extent to which architecture is considered successful is its adaptation to its specific region
									.</li>
									<li>Making our designs rich with natural information and moving away from blank walls. Biological understanding of architecture and the effect of biology on our perception of shapes and imitation of natural forms directly or implicitly
									.</li>
									<li>Interest in the role of Motifs in architecture.
									</li>
